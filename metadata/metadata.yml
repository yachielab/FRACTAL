description: FRACTAL (framework for distributed computing to trace large accurate
  lineages) is a new deep distributed computing framework that is designated to reconstruct
  extremely large lineages of nucleotide sequences using a software tool of choice.
  In brief, FRACTAL first subsamples a small number of sequences to reconstruct only
  an upper hierarchy of a target lineage and assigns the remaining sequences to its
  downstream clades, for each of which the same procedure is recursively iterated.
  Since the iteration procedure can be performed in parallel in a distributed computing
  framework, FRACTAL allows highly scalable reconstruction of an extremely large lineage
  tree.
